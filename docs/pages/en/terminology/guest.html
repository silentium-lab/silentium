  A guest is a visitor who is a function or object without
  introduction or an object with the introduction method that returns the value
  'guest'
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
  The guest receives the value from the data source once. But the library has
  mechanics in case the data source doesn't have any data at the moment, then
  you can set a value for the guest when the data first appears. For these mechanics
  see: PatronOnce, SourceEmpty
