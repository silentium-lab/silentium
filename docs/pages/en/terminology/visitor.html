  A visitor is an object or function that comes to a data source
to get some value.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
  If the visitor is a function, then he is considered a guest by default.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
  If the visitor is an object without the introduction method, then we also consider him a guest.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
  If the visitor is an object with the introduction method, then with the guest value
, it will be a guest, and with the patron value, it will be a patron
