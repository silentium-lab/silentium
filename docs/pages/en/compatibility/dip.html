  Dependency Inversion Principal
</h1>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
<b>DIP</b> is the dependency inversion principle described by Robert Martin.
  The principle says that the architect of the system can change the direction.
  procedural dependencies - when more depends on less on
  the opposite is true when less depends on more. More is higher
  policy (business logic) and plugins depend on the needs of business logic
  specific systems, for example, a database plugin that provides our business
  logic with data from the database.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
  The Patron library is an implementation of the DIP principle. Your business logic can
  depend on interfaces

  >
    ActionType

  . These common interfaces allow you to either get the data(sourceType) or
  accept the one to whom the data needs to be transferred (GuestType) or accept an object that
  can perform actions(ActionType)

  As can be seen from diagram 1, all classes depend only on interfaces from the library.
  Patron, only supplementing the parameters of generics with the necessary types.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
  The application code may look like this, as shown in Example 1.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-0 font-bold">Example 1.</p>
<pre
  class="mb-4"
><code class="language-js">// Conditional code to demonstrate the composition of classes in scheme 1
const credentials = new CredentialsFromPostRequest(request);

const user = new UserStatus(
    new SQLUserOfCredentials(credentials)
);

const card = new UserCard();
user.value(card);
</code></pre>

<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">
The benefits of using Patron are clearly visible, each class does not depend on anything
  in addition to the Patron library and those libraries of which it is a plug-in, and in the case of
  The business logic class will depend only on Patron.
