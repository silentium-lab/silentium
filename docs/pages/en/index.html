  Silentium = silence
  </h1>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  From Latin <a class="link" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/silentium" target="_blank">silentium is translated as silence</a>. The main feature of the silentium library is that an object, if it does not have a good answer to a question, may not give a bad answer, for example - null. This approach allows objects to better control their part of the work, and allows those objects that rely on the work of other objects to trust the received values, without spreading a lot of conditions for checking values ​​throughout the application. </p>

  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
  The core of the implementation is that objects are divided into two categories: Sources and Visitors.<br>
  <b>Sources</b> are objects with a <b>.value</b> method or functions expecting a visitor in the first argument.<br>
  <b>Visitors</b> are objects with a <b>.give</b> method or functions expecting a value in the first argument.<br>
  </p>
