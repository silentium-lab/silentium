# Silentium

To install the library you can use the command.

```bash
npm install silentium
```

The library helps you create abstractions for information in your system. Instead of working with data abstractions and operations abstractions, you can combine them into a common information abstraction. The approach in which we combine data and operations under information abstractions is object-oriented programming.

The idea for the project was born from the ideas of eolang and was inspired by this paper, 𝜑-calculus:
